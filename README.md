## What was used for building this project?
- Express
- Postgresql
- JWT
- MVC Design
- Javascript
## What was the main porpouse of this project?
Learning about authorization process, acessing an real database, using table relations and understanding why an ORM such as prisma and Typescript would help the development
## But why did i use PG?
PG uses pure sql queries and i see this as an important step to use the relational database with mastery
## Why not Typescript yet?
When i started the project i decided not to use Typescript, the reason is i wanted to understand why Typescript would make the development faster, decided to face pure Javacript
## Why CSS was not used?
I actually understand a bit of frontend but i dont think it is actually good enough, at some point i want to dive in frontend to become a fullstack developer, but even when i get a good understanding i will not update older projects, because i want to show the progress on learning each technology
## What i am going to learn now?
- Docker
- Mongo
- Typescript
### Why Mongo?
Although i did not use an ORM for Postgres in this project i already have an base on how it works and i do not want to use only relational dbs, so my next project for sure will use mongo and then Postgres with an ORM

- Authorization process with JWT
- MVC design
- Express
- Importance of Middlewares
- Logging status is important
- Organization helps a lot
- More about making a readable code
- Cookie is an good practice for storing JWT
